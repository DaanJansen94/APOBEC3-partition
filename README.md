# Create APOBEC3-partition
This script takes a nucleotide alignment in FASTA format as input and automatically generates two partitions: one for APOBEC3 and one for non-APOBEC3 sequences. To run the script, navigate to the directory containing your nucleotide alignment and execute the following:

```
python apobec3_analysis.py
```
